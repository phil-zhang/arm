ARM Addressing Modes (Pre-Indexing)
[Rn, ±Rm] Register offset
Address accessed is the value in Rn ± the value in Rm. Rn and Rm do not change values.
Example:
ldr r2, [r0, r1] @ r2 ← *(r0 + r1)

[Rn, ±Rm, shift] Scaled register offset
Address accessed is the value in Rn ± the value in Rm shifted as specified. Rn and Rm do not change values.
Example:
ldr r0, [r1, r2, lsl #2] @ r0 ← *(r1 + r2*4)
注意r0和r1均没有变化
